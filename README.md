## Description

This is an assignment provided by [Playgroung Inc.](https://playgroundinc.com/) which the objective is to implement in Node.js an app that exposes a single API endpoint at _**/unique-ify**_ that accepts _**GET requests**_ with a single _**parameter, text**_.

If text is a string composed of only letters (A-Z in any combination of upper and lower case) and/or spaces, it will return a string representation of the collection of unique letters that make up text, sorted alphabetically and provided in lower case.

Otherwise the endpoint should return an error accompanied with the message “Please only enter letters A-Z or spaces.”
